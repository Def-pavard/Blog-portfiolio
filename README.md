 Project: Truth AI ‚Äì Detailed Functioning

üéØ Project Objective

Truth AI is a minimalist artificial intelligence designed to instantly verify questionable information. Unlike generalist AIs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc.), it doesn't chat, keeps no history, and requires no registration. Truth AI acts as a discreet extension suited for social networks and fast information flows.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend (User Interface)

Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox) and possible API integration.

Ultra-simple interface: a field to paste or enter the information to check.

Single "Verify" button ‚Üí short and clear answer.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (Verification Engine)

Python/Node.js microservice with a lightweight NLP model.

Analyzes the user-provided statement and compares it against:

Fact-checking databases (Snopes, FactCheck.org, etc.)

Reliable news articles (via APIs or controlled scraping)

An internal credibility assessment model (classifier)



3Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Flow

1. The user pastes or types an information snippet.


2. The AI rephrases it to extract the core question.


3. The AI searches and cross-checks reliable sources.


4. It returns a simple answer ("True", "False", "Unverifiable"), with a link or short explanation.



4Ô∏è‚É£ No Data Retention

Requests are processed in RAM and immediately discarded.

No tracking, no user history.

üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS).

No account creation ‚Üí no personal database.

Anonymous technical logs for service stability only.

Complexity	Minimalist	Complex conversation
Main function	Factual verification	Dialogue, creation, code, etc.
Registration	No	Yes (almost always)
Size	Lightweight	Very large
